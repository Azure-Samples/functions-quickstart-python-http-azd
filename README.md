# Azure Functions Python HTTP Trigger using Azure Developer CLI

This template repository contains an HTTP trigger reference sample for Azure Functions written in Python and deployed to Azure using the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`). The sample uses managed identity and a virtual network to make sure deployment is secure by default.

This source code supports the article [Quickstart: Create and deploy functions to Azure Functions using the Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-azure-developer-cli?pivots=programming-language-python).

## Prerequisites

+ [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/)
+ [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?pivots=programming-language-python#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)
+ [Azure Developer CLI (AZD)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
+ To use Visual Studio Code to run and debug locally:
  + [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  + [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)

## Initialize the local project

You can initialize a project from this `azd` template in one of these ways:

+ Use this `azd init` command from an empty local (root) folder:

    ```shell
    azd init --template functions-quickstart-python-http-azd
    ```

    Supply an environment name, such as `flexquickstart` when prompted. In `azd`, the environment is used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app.

+ Clone the GitHub template repository locally using the `git clone` command:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd.git
    cd functions-quickstart-python-azd
    ```

    You can also clone the repository from your own fork in GitHub.

## Prepare your local environment

Add a file named `local.settings.json` in the root of your project with the following contents:

```json
{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python"
    }
}
```

## Create a virtual environment

The way that you create your virtual environment depends on your operating system.
Open the terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run these commands:

### Linux/macOS/bash

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows (Cmd)

```shell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\scripts\activate
```

## Run your app from the terminal

1. To start the Functions host locally, run these commands in the virtual environment:

    ```shell
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    func start
    ```

1. From your HTTP test tool in a new terminal (or from your browser), call the HTTP GET endpoint: <http://localhost:7071/api/httpget>

1. Test the HTTP POST trigger with a payload using your favorite secure HTTP test tool. This example uses the `curl` tool with payload data from the [`testdata.json`](./testdata.json) project file:

    ```shell
    curl -i http://localhost:7071/api/httppost -H "Content-Type: text/json" -d @testdata.json
    ```

1. When you're done, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the `func.exe` host process.

1. Run `deactivate` to shut down the virtual environment.

## Run your app using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the root folder in a new terminal.
1. Run the `code .` code command to open the project in Visual Studio Code.
1. Press **Run/Debug (F5)** to run in the debugger. Select **Debug anyway** if prompted about local emulator not running.
1. Send GET and POST requests to the `httpget` and `httppost` endpoints respectively using your HTTP test tool (or browser for `httpget`). If you have the [RestClient](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension installed, you can execute requests directly from the [`test.http`](test.http) project file.

## Source Code

The source code for both functions is in the [`function_app.py`](./function_app.py) code file. Azure Functions requires the use of the `@azure/functions` library.

This code shows an HTTP GET triggered function:  

```python
@app.route(route="httpget", methods=["GET"])
def http_get(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    name = req.params.get("name", "World")

    logging.info(f"Processing GET request. Name: {name}")

    return func.HttpResponse(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

This code shows an HTTP POST triggered function:

```python
@app.route(route="httppost", methods=["POST"])
def http_post(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    try:
        req_body = req.get_json()
        name = req_body.get('name')
        age = req_body.get('age')
        
        logging.info(f"Processing POST request. Name: {name}")

        if name and isinstance(name, str) and age and isinstance(age, int):
            return func.HttpResponse(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old!")
        else:
            return func.HttpResponse(
                "Please provide both 'name' and 'age' in the request body.",
                status_code=400
            )
    except ValueError:
        return func.HttpResponse(
            "Invalid JSON in request body",
            status_code=400
        )
```

## Deploy to Azure

Run this command to provision the function app, with any required Azure resources, and deploy your code:

```shell
azd up
```

Alternatively, you can opt-out of a VNet being used in the sample. To do so, use `azd env` to configure `SKIP_VNET` to `true` before running `azd up`:

```bash
azd env set SKIP_VNET true
azd up
```

You're prompted to supply these required deployment parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| _Environment name_ | An environment that's used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app. You aren't prompted when you created the local project using `azd init`.|
| _Azure subscription_ | Subscription in which your resources are created.|
| _Azure location_ | Azure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown.|

To learn how to obtain your new function endpoints in Azure along with the required function keys, see [Invoke the function on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-azure-developer-cli?pivots=programming-language-java#invoke-the-function-on-azure) in the companion article [Quickstart: Create and deploy functions to Azure Functions using the Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-azure-developer-cli?pivots=programming-language-java#invoke-the-function-on-azure).

## Redeploy your code

You can run the `azd up` command as many times as you need to both provision your Azure resources and deploy code updates to your function app.

>[!NOTE]
>Deployed code files are always overwritten by the latest deployment package.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, you can use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure and avoid incurring any further costs:

```shell
azd down
```
